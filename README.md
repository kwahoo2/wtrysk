Fuel injection (ECU) software written in Bascom for AVR8 back in 2009/2010 for educational purpuses.

Check [ster8mapa3216-EN.bas] for code with English comments.

The ECU was based on AVR Atmega8, EDIS-4 (as ignition power stage) and L298 for idle air stepper.

Fuel and ignition maps are embedded directly in the BAS file.
